# AutoSwitch Configuration File
# See https://github.com/dexman545/Fabric-Autoswitch/wiki/Configuration for more details.
# Setting an option to 'true' will enable it's stated behavior; using 'false' will disable it.


# When enabled, the config files will be regenerated upon every MC startup. This means any user-added config entries
# will be moved to the bottom in the 'Overrides' section. When disabled, the files will only be rewritten when the
# config version does not match expected one. Do note that the material and usable configs will not regenerate if
# removed with this disabled if the main config was not also removed.
# Default Value: false
alwaysRewriteConfigs = false

# If enabled, AutoSwitch will attempt to avoid recalculating hotbar slots to be used on a particular target. Each time
# that slot is modified, it's cached data is thrown out. This can benefit performance.
# Default Value: true

# Checks if a saddlable entity has a saddle for use action to switch. Does not allow switching to a saddle on hotbar.
# Default Value: true

# No touchy! For checking when to regen config files!

# The amount of remaining durability needed to trigger tool preservation.
# Default Value: 3

# This setting is meant to disable config GUI integration if in future the feature breaks, but the rest of AutoSwitch
# does not. Fallbacks are in place to ensure any changes to Minecraft do not break integration, this is simply a more
# extreme kill switch.
# Default Value: false
disableModMenuConfig = false

# Will force use of the toggle key in order to enable switching.
# Default Value: false

# When enabled, switching is disabled while the player is crouching/sneaking.

# Enable client-sided commands to modify options in this file, as well to toggle AS on/off during gameplay. Only
# effective on restart.

# Enable check for tool's ability to harvest the targeted block via comparison of mining levels.
# Default Value: true
miningLevelCheck = true

# Prefer tool with minimum mining level.
# Default Value: true

# Switch used tool to offhand if no item is there.

# Before switching back when using the 'attack' action, wait for the attack cooldown to finish. Fixes attacks not
# doing a lot of damage to mobs, and makes switchback for blocks visually smoother.

# Default Value: MOBS

# Controls where and if the keybinding toggle message should be displayed. DEFAULT is above the hotbar, like with bed

# Acceptable values: DEFAULT, CHAT, OFF
# Default Value: DEFAULT
toggleMessageControl = DEFAULT

# Enable to allow target list to stack enchantments. Disable for old behavior. When enabled, a target selector of
# 'tool;fortune, tool;mending' will prefer a tool with both fortune and mending over one with just fortune. This differs
# from 'tool;fortune&mending' in that only one enchantment is required for the tool to be selected, rather than both
# fortune and mending.
