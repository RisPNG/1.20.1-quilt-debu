# AutoSwitch Usable Configuration File
# This file defines tool switching targets for the 'use/interact' action (right clicking) on a mob or block. 
# Same format as the Attack Action Config:
# Format is a comma separated list of 'tool selectors', which take the form of 'toolname[;enchantment list]', 
# where toolname is either a ToolGrouping, or a specific item id with same formatting rules as enchantments.  
# Enchant list is optional. If present, it must be separated from the tool by a semicolon (';'). Enchantment list is a
# list of `enchantment id`s separated by `&`, such as 'minecraft!fortune&minecraft!mending'. The list can have infinite
# enchantments. If multiple enchantments are specified, only tools with *all* of the enchantments will be selected. Use
# multiple tool selectors to specify optional enchantments. See toolEnchantmentsStack in autoswitch.cfg. 
# Enchant and item id uses '!' instead of colons. A colon can be used as long as it is on the right of the equal sign.
# Example: minecraft!stick;minecraft!fortune 
# List is ordered and will affect tool selection. 
# You can add target overrides by adding it's id (replacing colon with '\:' or '!') on a new line and adding values to
# the right of 
# the equals sign ('=') as you would normally. Check the boat for an example. 
# Removing the values after the equals sign will disable the switch. In the case of overrides, the line may be removed
# for default behavior.
# If you would like to write config values across multiple lines, end the preceding line with '\', followed by a new
# line. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/8978515
